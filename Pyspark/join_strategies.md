- Broadcast Join (spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold)
- Sort Merge Join
  1. Shuffle partitions: spark.sql.shuffle.partitions (200 default)
        - Partition identifier for a row is determined as Hash(join key)% 200 
        - This type of repartitioning is called HashRepartitioning. Hash is computed by default using the .hashcode() method in java.

  2. Sorting within each partition
  3. Join the sorted partitions
